; DEWH_para.ini --- INI file to provide the required information regarding
; the Domestic Electric Water Heaters (DEWH) including:
; 1- Their Properties ( numbers and parameters)
; 2- Their Sets  (numbers, parameters, and their selection criterion)
; 3- How many days required to model the DEWHs behavior along with the sampling time

; First section provides the Number of DEWH Units
[Numbers of the DEWHs]

N=100      ; Numbers of the Units
Cp=4183    ; Specific Heat of the Water in DEWH in J/kgC
G=4.5      ; Surface Thermal Conductance of the DEWH in W/C


; Second section provides infromation about the Sets of DEWH Units
[Sets of the DEWHs]

S=2    ; Numbers of the Sets "Add the detials of each sset in the following keys start with S1"
S1=6000 300 55 50    ; Parameters of 1st Set [Rated Power_in_W    DEWH _Volume_in_L   High_Temperature_Setting_in_C    Low_Temperature Setting_in_C]
S2=3000 150 50 45   ; Parameters of 2nd Set [Rated Power_in_W    DEWH _Volume_in_L   High_Temperature_Setting_in_C    Low_Temperature Setting_in_C]
;S3=4000 200 52 47   ; Parameters of 3rd Set [Rated Power_in_W    DEWH _Volume_in_L   High_Temperature_Setting_in_C    Low_Temperature Setting_in_C]
Key_S=1    ; A criterion to select the Sets randomly or equally (Randomly-> Key_S=0), or (Equally-> Key_S=1)


; Third section provides the Number of Days to model the the DEWHs behavior
[Numbers of the Days]

D=1    ; Numbers of the days
Ts=600    ; Sampling time in seconds 'it is recommanded to be between 300 to 900 seconds, e.g. 5 to 15 mins to have better performance'
